# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org).


## [Unreleased](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/2.3.0...HEAD)

### Changed

- The license changed from [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) to [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).
  This change should not affect any users in practice.

  Since all code has been rewritten from scratch by me, no permissions from other contributors are required.
  The license for previous releases (and possible future releases in the 2.3.x branch) remains MIT, of course.

- To fascilitate the usage by users outside of the Python ecosystem, _doc2dash_ is now written in Go.
  That also comes with a significant performance increase.

  Binaries for all major platforms will be provided.
- All documentation switched from _reStructuredText_ to _Markdown_.


### Removed

- _pydoctor_ has been removed as a standalone parser because it now creates intersphinx-style `objects.inv` files.

This is the **final feature release** that uses Python and is installable from PyPI.
If necessary, there *may* be more 2.3.x bugfix releases.

- The dependencies aren't pinned anymore.
- ``lxml`` is not a dependency anymore.
- ``python -m doc2dash`` works now as expected.


## [2.2.0](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/2.1.0...2.2.0) - 2017-06-12

- ``InterSphinxParser`` is now open to extension.
  [\#59](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/pull/59)
- Support a ``--parser`` option to force the use of a custom parser class.
  [\#60](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/pull/60)


## [2.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/2.0.2...2.1.0) - 2016-03-14

- Remove legacy Sphinx parsing.
  The intersphinx parser is much more robust so the old way shouldn't be needed anymore.
- Add support for InterSphinx constants.
  [\#49](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/pull/49)
- Fix handling in-docs links with multiple anchors.
  [\#47](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/47)
- Add support for ``--enable-js`` and ``--online-redirect-url`` options.
  [\#43](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/43)
- Better support for relative paths.
  [\#37](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/37),
  [\#41](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/41)


## [2.0.2](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/2.0.1...2.0.2) - 2014-09-24

- Fix detection of [_pydoctor_ 0.5](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mwhudson/pydoctor/dev/revision/605).
  [\#31](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/31),
  [\#39](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/39)


## [2.0.1](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/2.0.0...2.0.1) - 2014-09-16

- Better Unicode support.
  The move from `unicode_literals` to explicit prefixes broke some things that are fixed now.
  [\#29](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/29),
  [\#30](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/30)


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/1.2.1...2.0.0) - 2014-08-14

- Added a new parser for Sphinx documentation that uses [intersphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html) files that are machine readable.
  That should lead to more reliable parsing and a better deduction of symbol types.
  [\#28](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/28)
- Added Sphinx-based documentation.
- Added colors, styles, and a progress bar to make output more comprehensible.
- `setup.py test` works now.
- Internally quite a few changes happened.
  Most prominently tuples and namedtuples have been replaced by real classes and parsers don't inherit from anything anymore.
  The fundamental working principal stayed the same though so porting your parsers is trivial.
